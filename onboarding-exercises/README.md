## Welcome!

Hi! If you're interested in playing around bitcoin core, you are in the right
place.

This folder has learning prompts intended to help you familiarize with
different components. My goal is not to provide _tests_ with _correct_ answers,
but rather to aid your personal learning. I learn best through tinkering, so
this is an attempt to offer a clear path in the infinitely branching options of
bitcoin & open source.

I've also written up this [blog
post](https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365) to
share different tools and mentalities that I've found useful during my
onboarding journey.

## Bitcoin Core Onboarding Roadmap
1. Clone the repo & compile the code. Make sure you can run functional tests &
   unit tests. Start the node & observe it running via logs & successful RPC
   calls. You don't need to sync to chain tip to see the node succesfully
   start up.

2. Start getting familiar with some code with this functional test
   [exercise](functional-tests.md).

3. Improve your understanding of the bitcoin protocol & start reading some C++
   code with the version handshake [exercise](version-handshake.md).

## Good Luck!
If you find yourself spending time with these exercises and want to discuss
your learnings, please reach out to me. I'd love to have a pair session and
discuss deeper :)

Enjoy!
