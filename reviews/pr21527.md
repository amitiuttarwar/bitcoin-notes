## `net_processing`: lock clean up

### commit #2: add `m_mutex_message_handling`
* adds an annotation to `ProcessMessage`:
  `LOCKS_EXCLUDED(m_mutex_message_handling)`
* Q: why is this not `LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_mutex_message_handling)`? I think the
  point of negative capabilities are to ensure we don't get false negatives in
  situations where double locking could occur, and that might not be a concern
  here since `ProcessMessage()` gets invoked externally, and the mutex is
  a private member. And since negative capabilities require the more particular
  config flag, opt for `LOCKS_EXCLUDED`?
* Is `ProcessMessage` ONLY for fuzz testing now? Can we update name to
  `ProcessMessageTest`? At least add docs.
* Why no excluded annotations on `ProcessMessages` and `SendMessages`?
* To review: `m_mutex_message_handling` is guarding anything & everything that
  is only accessed by `ProcessMessage(s)` & `SendMessages`.
This comment seems misleading, an example is misbehavior, accessed from another
thread.
  -> `SendMessages` -> `MaybeDiscourageAndDisconnect` -> `Misbehaving` ->
  `FinalizeNode` -> `ConnectTip` accesses some of the same stuff from this
  other thread.
