### commit #1

#### overview:
Avoid calling CAddrMan::Connected() on block-relay-only peer addresses.

Connected() updates the time we serve in addr messages, so avoid leaking
block-relay-only peers by avoiding these calls.


#### what it does:
- changes the function signature of `FinalizeNode` to take in a const reference
  instead of a node id
- adds logic to FinalizeNode to not set `fUpdateConnectionTime` to true if
  `IsBlockOnlyConn`

#### FinalizeNode()
- public function on `PeerManager`
- according to header comment: "handle removal of a peer by updating various
  state and removing it from `mapNodeState`"
- part of `NetEventsInterface` virtual class

- only caller: `net.cpp` -> `CConnman::DeleteNode`
    - if `fUpdateConnectionTime` is set to true, calls `addrman.Connected(addr)`


#### addrman.Connected()
- according to header comment: "Mark an entry as currently-connected-to"
- mostly just looks up the addr in the addrman (`mapAddr`), and if we find a
  matching entry, update `info.nTime`

only calling pathway: `DeleteNode` -> `FinalizeNode` -> `Connected()`

#### questions:
- looks like `fUpdateConnectionTime` is set to false in `DeleteNode` before
  calling `FinalizeNode`, as well as at the beginning of `FinalizeNode`. Is
  this necessary for safety? could this be better?


### commit #2

#### overview:
Call CaddrMan::Good() on block-relay-only peer addresses

Being able to invoke Good() is important for address management (new vs tried
table, tried table eviction via test-before-evict). We mitigate potential
information leaks by not calling Connected() on these peer addresses.

#### what it does:
- this addresses the conversation we had on my PR here:
  `https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19724#discussion_r470962473`

- changes `ProcessMessage` to `MarkAddressGood` if the connection is
  any type of outbound. previously block-relay-only skipped this, now they will
  hit this too.

#### questions:
- what exactly does `Good()` do?

### commit #3

#### overview:
Refactor test for existing peer connection into own function

#### what it does:
simple refactor that extracts two conditionals into
`AlreadyConnectedToAddress`: calling `FindNode` with addr & with
ip port / string

#### questions:
- why do we look up nodes by both the addr as well as ip port / string?

### commit #4

#### overview:
Avoid test-before-evict evictions of current peers

Outbound peer logic prevents connecting to addresses that we're already
connected to, so prevent inadvertent eviction of current peers via
test-before-evict by checking this condition and marking current peer's
addresses as Good().

#### `addrman.Select()`
  - takes in a boolean that defaults to false called `newOnly`
  - chooses an address to connect to
  - if `newOnly` is true, it chooses a node from the new table
  - otherwise, it has a 50% chance for choosing between new and tried table

#### what it does:
- `ThreadOpenConnections`

previously:
```
CAddrInfo addr = addrman.SelectTriedCollision();

if (!fFeeler || !addr.IsValid()) {
  addr = addrman.Select(fFeeler);
```

- if `fFeeler` is false: `addrman.Select(false)`
  - 50% chance of new vs tried
- if `fFeeler` is true, & there are no collisions, `addrman.Select(true)`
  - select a new address

--

now:
- if its not a feeler, choose randomly between new and tried table
- if it is a feeler,
  - see if there are any collisions on the tried tables.
    - no collision: select from the new table
    - yes collision & we are already connected to the address: mark the address
      as `Good()` since we wouldn't be able to initiate a connection anyways.
      select an address from the new table
    - yes collision & we are not connected: don't need to update addr, its
      already set to the collision address that we want to try
