Hi! If you're interested in learning more about P2P in bitcoin & bitcoin core,
you are in the right place.

This folder has learning prompts intended to help you familiarize with
different P2P components. My goal is not to provide a _test_ with _correct_
answers, but rather to offer some direction to aid your personal learning.

If you find yourself spending time with these exercises and want to discuss
your learnings, please reach out to me. I'd love to have a pair session and
discuss deeper :)

Enjoy!
